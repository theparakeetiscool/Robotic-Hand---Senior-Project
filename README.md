README

This repository is dedicated to storing the code I wrote for an Arduino UNO during my senior project at BASIS

If you'd like to use this code you will likely have to change out the pins according to what you're using (and what board you're using)

Hardware required:
2 L298N Motor Drivers
5 N20 DC Motors
External power source (preferably 2V and >2A)
Breaboard / Protoboard
Pin Wires
Connection Cable (In the case of an Arduino UNO, a USB A to USB B cable)

Overall, this project costed me ~$180 but you can probably do it for ~$160 if you buy good value products and aren't on a strict timeline.

For any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out at johnawells07@gmail.com
